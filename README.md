    * Make evident that the app is “powered by Namahn”​
    * The Namahn website is one click away.​

    * Product owners can manage the arguments that are presented to the users (view, create, edit, delete) ​
    * The application is responsive!​
    * Fresh and dynamic look&feel. 

* Deliverables:
    * Detailed black & white wireframes​
